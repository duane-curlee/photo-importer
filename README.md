# photo-importer
Python tool to import photos into a structured folder archive

This tool will copy only \*.jpg and \*.jpeg files from a given source directory and put them into a photo archive. My choice of archive is $HOME\Photos

The Photos are arranged in a structure of Photos\(4-digit year)\(2-digit month)\(2-digit date)\(original file name) - much like the Gnome Desktop application Shotwell arranged them.

This script does not delete the files from the source.
